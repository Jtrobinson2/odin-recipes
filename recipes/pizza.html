  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Pizza is a popular and versatile dish that originated in Italy but has
    become a global favorite. It typically consists of a flat, round base of
    dough topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various ingredients such as
    meats, vegetables, and herbs. The dough is often thin and crispy, although
    thicker crust options are also available. Pizzas are commonly baked in
    ovens, and they come in a variety of styles, including Neapolitan, New
    York, Chicago deep-dish, and more. Pizza is enjoyed by people of all ages
    and is often a social and customizable meal.
