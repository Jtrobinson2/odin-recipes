    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        A salad is a dish consisting of a mixture of raw or cooked vegetables, fruits, and sometimes other ingredients,
        typically served cold or at room temperature. Salads can vary widely in terms of ingredients, flavors, and
        preparations. Common components of salads include leafy greens (such as lettuce or spinach), tomatoes,
        cucumbers, carrots, and various other vegetables.

        Salads may also incorporate proteins like grilled chicken, shrimp, or tofu, as well as toppings such as cheese,
        croutons, nuts, or seeds. Dressings, which are often vinaigrettes or creamy concoctions, add flavor and moisture
        to the salad.

        The versatility of salads allows for endless possibilities, and they can be tailored to suit personal
        preferences or dietary restrictions. Salads are appreciated for their freshness, nutritional value, and the
        ability to be a light and refreshing meal or a hearty and satisfying one.
